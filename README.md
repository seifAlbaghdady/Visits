Project Visits
Description
This project demonstrates a simple Node.js and Express application that uses Redis for data storage. It provides a basic server that keeps track of the number of visits to a webpage.

Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

Node.js (version X.X.X)
Docker (version X.X.X)
Docker Compose (version X.X.X)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Install the required Node.js dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
npm install
Build the Docker image by running the following command:

arduino
Copy code
docker build -t <image-name> .
Replace <image-name> with the desired name for your Docker image.

Usage
Start the application using Docker Compose:

Copy code
docker-compose up
This command will start two containers: one for the Node.js application and another for the Redis server.

Access the application by opening your web browser and visiting http://localhost:8081.

You should see a webpage displaying the number of visits.

To stop the application, use the following command:

Copy code
docker-compose down
Configuration
The application connects to the Redis server using the hostname redis-server and port 6379. This configuration is defined in the Node.js code:

javascript
Copy code
const client = redis.createClient({
  host: 'redis-server',
  port: 6379,
});
If you need to modify the Redis server configuration, you can do so in the docker-compose.yml file.
